            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I began my journey into web-development in 2015 when I went back to school for my Associate's degree. Previously I ran a CNC router in a fast-paced production environment where I designed &amp; built custom products. I was a professional cabinet maker for more than a decade, doing everything from programming and maintaining the router to fine woodworking &amp; furniture repair/restoration.</p>
                            
            <aside id="portrait"><img src="img/SFK270x480.png" alt="Portrait of me, Sean Keller"></aside>    
            <p>Before that life I was a live audio engineer in the Midwest where I worked with artists such as Blue October, Michael Franti &amp; hundreds of local bands. I was involved in everything from loading equipment, to setting up the stage, top, lights and sound equipment, to running any of the; lights, FOH audio or monitor audio. FOH stands for Front of House and involves the generally stereo speaker setup the audience hears. The monitor engineer runs sound for all the players on stage so they're able to hear each other, often a much more difficult job. </p>

            <p>I build custom furniture in my garage, and have done so for a few companies in the past. At one I did furniture repair and restoration, a real challenge for me professionally.
